  "schema:description": "Robert Gray Byers was born in Iowa and resided in Pasadena, California before enrolling as a student at the University Farm (now UC Davis). While at Davis he served as a member of the Blue and Gold Dairy Club and also on the Refreshment and Decorating Committees for Picnic Day. He completed a three year degree in agriculture at the University Farm in 1921. He passed away on August 22, 1926 at the age of twenty five in Half Moon Bay, California. These two scrapbooks chronicle his time as a student on campus. The first scrapbook features the years 1919-1920 while the second one focuses on 1921. The first scrapbook begins with photographs of General Pershing's visit to Davis by railcar. It also contains images of Byers and some of his classmates as well as campus activities such as Labor Day, the tug of war, and the tank rush. Also included are pictures of Bear Lake and the California State Capitol Building. The second scrapbook features campus and city structures such as North Hall, East Hall, and West Hall, the Creamery, the Horticulture Building, and the Davis Arch. Images of Picnic Day are also included as well as a visit to Mt. Tamalpais, Bolinas, and Muir Woods. \n\n The collectionâ€™s finding aid is available at the [Online Archive of California](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8pz5hpf/).",
